First off, this is NOT my code.
This is my copy of airnef which does not support my camera (Nikon S7000).  After a bit of searching, I found where someone else (I'll add credit later) posted code that allowed airnef to work with the Nikon S7000.
I have added this repository so that I may either do a tidier fix or something more.  Mainly, it is so that I have it when I need it later.
I tried multiple times to register on the author's website, without success, so I am unable to contact him/her. Hopefully any fixes I post here will eventually make their way to the original author.
